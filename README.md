Fusion Pipeline officially works on RIS compute1. :hugs: In the mean time, here are the new hightlights:

1. Suitable for batch jobs and large projects, providing the project has the catalog in these format (./https://github.com/ding-lab/GDAN.catalog/blob/main/Alchemist/Alchemist.RNAMap.storage1.tsv) .
2. Currently, this Fusion pipeline is designed to work for 3 main projects: PE-CGS, ALCHEMIST and CPTAC3
