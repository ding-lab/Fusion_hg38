# Fusion_hg38

Fusion Pipeline officially works on RIS compute1. :hugs: In the mean time, here are the hightlight updates:

1. Suitable for batch jobs and large projects, providing the project has the catalog in these format.
2. Currently, this Fusion pipeline is designed to work for 3 main projects: PE-CGS, ALCHEMIST and CPTAC3


Thanks a lot to Qingsong and Daniel Cui Zhou who developed and optimized this pipeline.
